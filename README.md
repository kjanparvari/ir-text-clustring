# Wikipedia Document Clustering  

A project to cluster Wikipedia documents using the **Rocchio Algorithm**. This project was developed as part of the **Information Retrieval course** at **Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)**. It focuses on applying relevance feedback techniques for document clustering and organization.  

## Features  
- **Rocchio Algorithm**: Implements the Rocchio method for clustering documents based on relevance feedback.  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Transforms text documents into feature vectors for clustering.  
- **Wikipedia Data**: Uses a subset of Wikipedia documents for analysis and clustering.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn  

## Purpose  
This project demonstrates the use of information retrieval techniques, particularly relevance feedback, for clustering and organizing text documents in a meaningful way.
